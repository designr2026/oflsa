The Incoterms®️ (International Commercial Terms) are essential in international trade as they define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers regarding the delivery of goods. Each term specifies who is responsible for shipping, insurance, duties, and tariffs, thereby minimizing disputes and misunderstandings. Here’s a more detailed look at each Incoterm and its implications:

 1.⁠ ⁠EXW (Ex Works):

   - Seller’s Responsibility: Delivers goods to a carrier or specified location.
   - Buyer’s Responsibility: Takes over once the goods are delivered to the carrier.

   - Seller’s Responsibility: Pays for transportation to the destination.
   - Buyer’s Responsibility: Risk transfers to the buyer once the goods are handed to the carrier.
